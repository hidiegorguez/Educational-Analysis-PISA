# PISA Data Educational Analysis

**We delve into PISA data to uncover how financial resources, teachers' salaries, and other factors correlate with student academic performance.**

**Please note:** The analysis and contents of this project are primarily in Spanish.

## What's the Big Question?

We're digging into PISA's treasure trove to figure out the link between educational investments and student performance. Also, we're curious about the role that social and economic conditions play in shaping education outcomes.

## Questions and Hypotheses

We're pondering whether there's a tangible return on educational investment in terms of academic outcomes and how teachers' pay might influence educational quality. Our investigation centers on whether better-paid teachers are tied to better student results and if this correlates with the rate of youth not in education, employment, or training (NEET).

## Our Goals

Our aim is to pinpoint key variables that shed light on these questions. We're deploying regression models and time series analysis to sift through the data and predict educational trends across various countries, including potential future scenarios for Spain.
